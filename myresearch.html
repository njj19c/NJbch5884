	<p>In Dr. Lazenby's laboratory, we focus on research involving micro and nanosensor technologies,
	as well as scanning electrochemical probe microscopies (SEPMs). While I have done recent work using macro-scale
	Pt working electrodes to characterize the electroactivity of members of the Lanthanide series,
	via cyclic voltammetry, my primary research project involves the fabrication of an ATP sensor
	within a nanopipette.These nanopipettes are pulled using a P-2000 CO2 Laser Puller at a variety of parameteters,
	depending on whether they are borosilicate or quartz glass.</p>
	<p id="single">Once fabricated, these sensors should not only be capable of reversible ATP detection in solution, but also be suitable to use in scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), whereby I intend to map out the ATP activity above various cell types.</p>

Components involved in voltammetric setup. A nanopipette is positioned in a glass full of electrolyte solution and a wire electrode is placed inside it to serve as working electrode. A reference electrode is placed in solution alongside it.

<p> Here I hope to make many future refinements. For later purposes of additional images on separate projects, I am boxing it in. I also hope to provide a more clear cut table that displays good data. Potential equations here formatted and separated out would also be good to have.</p>
